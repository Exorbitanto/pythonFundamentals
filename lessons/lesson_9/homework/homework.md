## Ex 1:

Create a function that will return the Fibonacci sequence up to N terms. Where N is an argument.

The Fibonacci Sequence is a series of numbers. The next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it. The
first two numbers are 0 and 1.

_For example, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21. The next number in this series above is 13+21 = 34._

Then create a test function to test your Fibonacci function with a number input from the user.

## Ex 2:

Given the following .json [file](employee_list.json). If you want, you can check how it was
generated [here](examples/employee_generator.py)

_Note: salary value is amount per month_

Create a program that will:

* List all employee names
* List all position names
* Calculate the amount of salary the company has to pay per month in total
* Calculate the amount of money the company has to pay in taxes per month. (Tax % Value is input from the console)
* Display information for the top 10 highest paid employees (name, position, salary, employment_start_date) from highest
  paid to lower.
* Display information for the top 10 employees with the longest time in the company (name, position, salary,
  employment_start_date) from highest to lower.
